# Translitrator
This translitrator can convert letter by letter Urdu to English and vice versa
This code is a simple transliterator that converts text between English and Urdu. It uses the art module to display fancy text, enhancing the user interface. Initially, the program prints a decorative title "TRANSLITRATOR". The user is then prompted to input a word or phrase in English. The code utilizes a dictionary that maps each English letter to its corresponding Urdu character. As it iterates over the input word, it builds the transliterated string in Urdu. The result is then printed, showing both the original English text and its Urdu transliteration.

Following this, the program displays the "TRANSLITRATOR" title again and prompts the user to input a word or phrase in Urdu. A second dictionary is used to map Urdu characters to their corresponding English letters. The code iterates over the Urdu input, converting each character to English and building the transliterated string. The final result is printed, displaying both the original Urdu text and its English transliteration. This process provides a straightforward way to convert text between these two languages, helping users understand the phonetic equivalents in each script.
